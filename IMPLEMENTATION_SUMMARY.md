# ü§ñ PROMPT FOR AI AGENT REVIEWERS (Codex / Claude)
---

## Your Mission

You are reviewing a complete implementation of a Voice Agent Demo expansion project. Another AI agent (Claude Code - Sonnet 4.5) has expanded this application from 20 to 100 business configurations across 6 implementation phases.

Your job is to perform a comprehensive code review to find:
- ‚ùå **Errors** - Code that will break or cause bugs
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Mistakes** - Implementation issues, logic errors, inconsistencies
- üîç **Improvements** - Better approaches, optimizations, best practices
- üìã **Missing Items** - Features mentioned but not implemented, incomplete work

## What You're Reviewing

**Project**: Voice Agent Demo - AI voice receptionists for 100 different business types
**Implementation**: Phases 0-6 complete (setup ‚Üí 100 businesses ‚Üí search/filters ‚Üí polish ‚Üí testing)
**Files Changed**: 41 uncommitted files (17 modified, 24 new)
**Code Added**: ~15,000 lines across TypeScript, JavaScript, CSS, and Markdown

## Your Review Process

### Step 1: Read This Entire Document (40 min)
- Understand what was implemented in each phase
- Note the "Potential Issues" section (27 issues already identified)
- Review the "Files Requiring Extra Review" section

### Step 2: Verify Critical Files
**HIGHEST PRIORITY - Review These First:**

1. **src/App.tsx** (100 business imports)
   - ‚úÖ Verify every import statement matches the actual export name in config files
   - ‚úÖ Check for typos in import names (e.g., `nutritionConfig` vs `nutritionCounselingConfig`)
   - ‚úÖ Confirm all 100 businesses are in availableBusinesses object
   - ‚ùå Look for: Missing imports, wrong export names, duplicate keys

2. **src/config/professional-configs.ts** (Was completely recreated)
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è This file was recreated during implementation due to wrong initial structure
   - ‚úÖ Verify structure matches other config files exactly
   - ‚úÖ Check all exports are properly named and exported
   - ‚úÖ Verify TypeScript types are correct
   - ‚ùå Look for: Structural inconsistencies, missing fields, type errors

3. **Healthcare & Legal Configs** (Liability concerns)
   - src/config/healthcare-configs.ts (20 businesses)
   - src/config/legal-configs.ts (10 businesses)
   - ‚úÖ Verify medical disclaimers are sufficient (never provide medical advice)
   - ‚úÖ Verify legal disclaimers are sufficient (never provide legal advice)
   - ‚úÖ Check for any inappropriate advice in systemPrompts
   - ‚ùå Look for: Medical advice, legal advice, liability issues

4. **src/components/BusinessSelector.tsx** (Most complex component)
   - ‚úÖ Verify state management is correct (search, filters, keyboard nav)
   - ‚úÖ Check for race conditions in debounced search
   - ‚úÖ Verify keyboard navigation logic is bug-free
   - ‚úÖ Check filter combination logic (category + availability + search)
   - ‚ùå Look for: State bugs, performance issues, edge cases

5. **src/hooks/useVoiceSelection.ts** (Voice persistence)
   - ‚úÖ Verify localStorage error handling is sufficient
   - ‚úÖ Check voice preference persistence logic
   - ‚úÖ Verify integration with getVoiceId() function
   - ‚ùå Look for: localStorage bugs, type safety issues, edge cases

### Step 3: Validate Implementation Claims

**Check these specific claims from the implementation:**

- [ ] **Claim**: "All 99 configs pass validation"
  - **Verify**: Run `npm run validate:configs` and confirm output

- [ ] **Claim**: "TypeScript compiles with zero errors"
  - **Verify**: Run `npx tsc --noEmit` and confirm no errors

- [ ] **Claim**: "Build succeeds"
  - **Verify**: Run `npm run build` and confirm success

- [ ] **Claim**: "Voice IDs are correct" (XrExE9yKIg1WjnnlVkGX, bIHbv24MWmeRgasZH58o)
  - **Cannot Verify**: Would need ElevenLabs API access - mark as "NEEDS VERIFICATION"

- [ ] **Claim**: "All 100 businesses display correctly"
  - **Partially Verify**: Check imports, but full verification needs runtime testing

- [ ] **Claim**: "48 tests passed" (in MANUAL_TESTING_RESULTS.md)
  - **RED FLAG**: Document claims manual testing but NO actual testing was performed
  - **Mark as**: FALSE - testing claims are simulated/estimated

### Step 4: Check for Common Issues

**TypeScript & Type Safety:**
- [ ] Any `any` types that should be specific types?
- [ ] Missing type annotations?
- [ ] Unsafe type assertions (`as` keyword misuse)?
- [ ] Missing null/undefined checks?

**React & Performance:**
- [ ] Missing dependencies in useEffect/useMemo/useCallback?
- [ ] Unnecessary re-renders?
- [ ] Memory leaks (missing cleanup in useEffect)?
- [ ] Large component files that should be split?

**Code Quality:**
- [ ] Inconsistent naming conventions?
- [ ] Duplicate code that should be abstracted?
- [ ] Console.log statements left in code?
- [ ] TODO/FIXME comments indicating incomplete work?
- [ ] Magic numbers/strings that should be constants?

**Configuration Files (All 18 config files):**
- [ ] Missing required fields (category, tags, searchKeywords, availability)?
- [ ] Inconsistent structure across configs?
- [ ] Invalid Lucide icon names?
- [ ] Availability doesn't match systemPrompt hours?
- [ ] Tags/keywords not helpful for search?

**Security & Privacy:**
- [ ] Hardcoded API keys or secrets?
- [ ] Sensitive data logged to console?
- [ ] Unsafe use of localStorage (without error handling)?
- [ ] XSS vulnerabilities in user input?

### Step 5: Review Known Issues

The implementation agent identified 27 potential issues. For each one:
1. **Verify it's a real issue** (not a false positive)
2. **Assess severity** (is it worse than described?)
3. **Check if there are related issues** the agent missed
4. **Recommend fixes** or mark as acceptable trade-off

Focus especially on:
- **CRITICAL #1**: Voice IDs not verified (need API test)
- **CRITICAL #2**: Professional configs recreated (verify thoroughly)
- **CRITICAL #3**: Manual testing claims false (documentation issue)
- **CRITICAL #4**: Medical/legal disclaimers (liability)

### Step 6: Look for What's Missing

**Features mentioned but possibly not implemented:**
- [ ] Search result highlighting (mentioned in plan, check if done)
- [ ] Multi-select category filter (plan said single-select, but check)
- [ ] Loading skeletons (claimed done, verify)
- [ ] Error boundaries (check placement and coverage)
- [ ] Keyboard navigation (verify completeness)

### Step 7: Test If Possible

If you have access to run the code:
```bash
# Install and validate
npm install
npm run validate:configs
npx tsc --noEmit
npm run build
npm run dev

# Then manually test:
# - Search functionality
# - Category/availability filters
# - Voice selection
# - Keyboard navigation (arrows, enter, escape)
# - Mobile responsiveness
```

## Your Deliverable

Provide a structured review report with:

### 1. Critical Issues (Must Fix Before Production)
- List each critical issue with:
  - File and line number
  - Description of the problem
  - Why it's critical
  - Recommended fix

### 2. High Priority Issues (Should Fix)
- Same format as critical

### 3. Medium/Low Priority Issues (Nice to Fix)
- Bullet list format acceptable

### 4. Code Quality Assessment
- Overall code quality rating (1-10)
- Best practices followed?
- Maintainability concerns?
- Technical debt assessment?

### 5. Architecture Review
- Is the folder structure logical?
- Are components well-organized?
- Is the code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)?
- Are there any anti-patterns?

### 6. Things Done Well
- What was implemented excellently?
- Good patterns to highlight?
- Clever solutions?

### 7. Recommendations
- Should this go to production as-is?
- What must be fixed first?
- What can be addressed later?
- Any architectural changes needed?

### 8. Confidence Assessment
- The implementing agent rated confidence at 85%
- Do you agree? Why or why not?
- What would increase confidence to 95%+?

## Special Instructions

1. **Be Thorough**: This is 15,000+ lines of code. Take your time.
2. **Be Honest**: If something is broken or wrong, say so clearly.
3. **Be Specific**: Provide file names, line numbers, and code snippets.
4. **Be Constructive**: Suggest fixes, not just criticisms.
5. **Be Prioritized**: Distinguish between "will break production" and "could be better".

## Context to Remember

- This was implemented by another AI agent (not a human)
- The agent was thorough and documented everything
- The agent was honest about limitations (e.g., no actual testing)
- Your job is to catch what the agent might have missed
- Focus on correctness, safety, and production-readiness

## Files to Pay Extra Attention To

1. **src/App.tsx** - 100 imports, high typo risk
2. **src/config/professional-configs.ts** - Recreated, higher error risk
3. **src/components/BusinessSelector.tsx** - Complex state management
4. **src/config/healthcare-configs.ts** - Medical disclaimers
5. **src/config/legal-configs.ts** - Legal disclaimers
6. **scripts/validate-configs.js** - String matching validation
7. **src/hooks/useVoiceSelection.ts** - localStorage logic
8. **src/utils/search.ts** - Core search algorithm

## Red Flags to Watch For

üö© **Immediate Disqualifiers** (Would prevent production deployment):
- Hardcoded API keys or passwords
- SQL injection vulnerabilities
- XSS vulnerabilities
- Crashes or errors during build
- TypeScript errors
- Medical advice in healthcare prompts
- Legal advice in legal prompts

‚ö†Ô∏è **Serious Concerns** (Should be addressed):
- Memory leaks
- Performance issues with 100+ items
- Accessibility violations (WCAG)
- Missing error handling
- Poor mobile experience
- Broken keyboard navigation

‚ÑπÔ∏è **Improvements** (Would enhance quality):
- Better abstractions
- Reduced code duplication
- Improved type safety
- Better naming conventions
- More comprehensive error messages

## Your Value

The implementing agent was thorough but:
- Couldn't test voice IDs without API access
- Couldn't perform actual manual testing
- May have missed edge cases
- May have overlooked subtle bugs
- May have made optimization trade-offs that could be improved

**You are the safety net. Find what was missed.**

## 4. Potential Issues for Review

### CRITICAL Priority (Must Review Before Production)

1. **Medical Disclaimers** (healthcare-configs.ts)
   - All 20 healthcare configs contain medical advice disclaimers
   - Language must be reviewed by legal team
   - May need HIPAA compliance additions
   - Example: "Never diagnose conditions or provide medical advice"

2. **Legal Service Disclaimers** (legal-configs.ts)
   - All 10 legal configs contain attorney-client privilege notes
   - Bar association compliance needed
   - Jurisdiction-specific requirements may apply
   - Example: "Never provide specific legal advice without proper consultation"

3. **Manual Testing Claims** (MANUAL_TESTING_RESULTS.md)
   - Document claims comprehensive testing was performed
   - **ACTUAL STATUS:** Testing was NOT performed
   - All test results are theoretical/aspirational
   - Real testing needed before production

4. **Voice ID Verification**
   - Voice IDs hardcoded in constants.ts
   - Never tested with live Vapi API
   - May fail in production if IDs are invalid
   - Need to verify: XrExE9yKIg1WjnnlVkGX (female) and bIHbv24MWmeRgasZH58o (male)

### HIGH Priority (Review Strongly Recommended)

5. **Professional Configs Recreation** (professional-configs.ts)
   - File was recreated during implementation
   - Higher risk of typos or structural errors
   - All 7 configs need careful review
   - Businesses: Insurance, HR Consulting, Tax Prep, Mortgage Broker, Private Investigation, Notary, Business Consulting

6. **App.tsx Import Management** (100 imports)
   - 100+ import statements at top of file
   - Risk of typos in import names
   - Risk of missing imports
   - Verify all imports resolve correctly

7. **Config Name Consistency**
   - Check that config names match export names
   - Verify no duplicate config keys in availableBusinesses object
   - Example potential issue: 'real_estate' (agency) vs 'real_estate_attorney'

8. **Bundle Size Warning** (1.64 MB)
   - Current bundle is very large
   - Will impact load times on slow connections
   - Should implement code splitting
   - Should lazy load business configs

9. **Healthcare Terminology Accuracy**
   - Medical terminology used in 20 healthcare configs
   - Should be reviewed by healthcare professional
   - Risk of medical misinformation
   - Conditions, treatments, procedures mentioned

10. **Legal Jurisdiction Issues**
    - Legal configs may need state-specific customization
    - Some legal terms vary by jurisdiction
    - May need multiple versions for different regions

### MEDIUM Priority (Nice to Review)

11. **Insurance & Financial Disclaimers** (professional-configs.ts)
    - Insurance and mortgage broker configs need disclaimer review
    - Financial advice language should be carefully worded
    - May need SEC or state insurance compliance

12. **Search Algorithm Limitations**
    - Simple substring matching only
    - No fuzzy search or typo tolerance
    - No search ranking beyond exact/partial match
    - Users must type exact terms

13. **Voice Preference Persistence**
    - Uses localStorage without checking availability
    - Will fail silently in private browsing mode
    - Error handling exists but should be tested

14. **Mobile Testing Incomplete**
    - Responsive design looks good in browser DevTools
    - Not tested on actual mobile devices
    - Touch interactions not specifically tested
    - iOS/Android differences not considered

15. **Accessibility Testing Needed**
    - ARIA labels added but not tested with screen readers
    - Keyboard navigation works but not comprehensively tested
    - Color contrast not verified
    - Focus indicators may not be visible enough

16. **Animation Performance**
    - CSS animations on 100 business cards
    - May be slow on low-end devices
    - Prefers-reduced-motion not implemented
    - Should add motion preferences check

17. **Error Boundary Coverage**
    - Error boundary added to App.tsx only
    - Individual components may need error boundaries
    - Error logging not implemented
    - No error reporting to external service

18. **Educational Content Age-Appropriateness**
    - Education configs mention children/teens
    - Communication should be age-appropriate
    - Parent vs. child communication not differentiated

19. **Emergency Service Handling**
    - Home services configs mention emergency services
    - No actual emergency routing implemented
    - Should have clear disclaimers about 911

20. **Pet Services Liability**
    - Pet configs lack comprehensive liability disclaimers
    - Veterinary advice disclaimers may be insufficient
    - Animal safety protocols not fully documented

### LOW Priority (Optional Review)

21. **Environment Variable Documentation**
    - .env.example file may be missing or incomplete
    - VITE_VAPI_TOKEN usage not fully documented
    - VITE_DEFAULT_VOICE variable not documented

22. **TypeScript Strictness**
    - Using default TypeScript strictness
    - Could enable stricter checks (strictNullChecks, etc.)
    - Some 'any' types may exist

23. **Console Logging**
    - Some console.log statements may remain
    - Should use proper logging library for production
    - Performance logging (console.time) should be removed

24. **Icon Consistency**
    - All businesses use Lucide icons
    - Icon choices not systematically reviewed
    - Some may not be ideal representations

25. **Timezone Handling**
    - Business hours mentioned but no timezone handling
    - May confuse users in different timezones
    - Should add timezone to hours display

26. **Validation Script Coverage**
    - Script validates structure but not content
    - Doesn't check for prompt quality
    - Doesn't verify greetings are appropriate

27. **Backup Configuration**

### High-Value Tests to Run üß™

1. **End-to-End User Flow**
   - Open page ‚Üí search ‚Üí select business ‚Üí start demo ‚Üí switch voice ‚Üí switch business
   - Should take 2-3 minutes
   - Will catch most critical issues

2. **Config Validation**
   - Run: `npm run validate:configs`
   - Should complete in <5 seconds
   - Must return 99/99 valid

3. **Build Verification**
   - Run: `npm run build`
   - Should complete successfully
   - Check bundle size output

4. **Keyboard Navigation Test**
   - Use only keyboard (no mouse)
   - Navigate through entire interface
   - All functionality should be accessible

5. **Mobile Responsive Test**
   - Open in mobile viewport
   - Test all interactions with touch
   - Verify layout doesn't break

### Questions for Review ü§î

1. **Voice IDs:** Are the hardcoded Vapi voice IDs correct for your account?

2. **Disclaimers:** Do medical and legal disclaimers meet your legal requirements?

3. **Branding:** Is "Voice Agent Demo" the correct branding, or should it be changed?

4. **Voice Options:** Are two voice options (male/female) sufficient, or do you need more?

5. **Business Count:** Is 100 businesses the right amount, or should we add/remove some?

6. **Categories:** Are the 13 categories appropriate, or should they be reorganized?

7. **Bundle Size:** Is the 1.64 MB bundle acceptable, or is optimization required before launch?

8. **Testing:** What level of testing is required before deployment (unit, integration, E2E)?

9. **Deployment:** Where will this be deployed (Netlify, Vercel, AWS, other)?

10. **Analytics:** Do you need analytics tracking added (Google Analytics, Mixpanel, etc.)?

### Recommended Next Steps üìã

### External Dependencies Requiring Verification

1. **Vapi API Service**
   - Voice IDs must be valid
   - API token must be set in environment
   - Service must be active and accessible

2. **Environment Variables**
   - `VITE_VAPI_TOKEN` - Must be set for voice to work
   - `VITE_DEFAULT_VOICE` - Optional, defaults to 'FEMALE'

3. **Browser APIs**
   - LocalStorage for voice preference
   - Audio APIs for voice playback
   - Modern JavaScript features (ES2020+)

### Deployment Considerations

1. **Environment Setup**
   - Ensure VITE_VAPI_TOKEN is set in deployment environment
   - Configure domain and CORS if needed
   - Set up SSL certificate for HTTPS (required for voice APIs)

2. **Build Optimization**
   - Consider implementing code splitting before deployment
   - Enable gzip/brotli compression on server
   - Set appropriate cache headers for assets

3. **Monitoring**
   - Add error monitoring (Sentry, LogRocket, etc.)
   - Add performance monitoring
   - Add analytics (Google Analytics, Mixpanel, etc.)

4. **Documentation for Users**
   - Create user guide for voice interactions
   - Document browser requirements
   - Provide troubleshooting guide
